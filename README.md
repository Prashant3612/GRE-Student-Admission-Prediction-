# GRE-Student-Admission-Prediction-

## Overview
This project predicts the selection of students for graduate programs based on their GRE scores, TOEFL scores, university rating, statement of purpose, letter of recommendation, GPA, and research experience. It leverages TensorFlow and Keras to build and train a machine learning model for prediction.

## Features
- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical features.
- Model Building: Using TensorFlow and Keras to construct and compile a neural network model.
- Model Training: Training the model with the dataset and evaluating its performance.
- Prediction: Making predictions on new data.
